# OTA-FIX
<BR>
OTA-FIX is a home automation start-up project that uses IOT technology to automate the "dumb" devices in our homes.
<br>
The product basically envisions to connect every device in home to the internet so that it can be controlled and monitored remotely thereby making our home smart.
<br>
I, daksh narula along with my friends from college have developed the complete product that can replace the old and boring switches in our home with new and mobile controlled devices that can be controlled from anywhere around the world.
